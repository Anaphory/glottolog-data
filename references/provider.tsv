Fabre, Alain. (1998) Manual de las lenguas ind�genas sudamericanas, I-II (LINCOM Handbooks in Linguistics 4-5). M�nchen: Lincom. 

Since 2005, there has been a continually updated electronic version
posted http://butler.cc.tut.fi/~fabre/BookInternetVersio/Alkusivu.html
(accessed 10 Apr 2011). The bibliography included here is a version of
the documents from the summer of 2009 and was automatically parsed by
HH. The automatical parsing could not be done error-free and a number
of such errors have yet to be weeded out. It was annotated for
language, using Fabre's well-informed language divisions. It was
automatically matched with iso-639-3 languages -- a conversion which
has glitches for some closely related varities. The collection
contains entries of linguistics and ethnography of South American
Indian peoples."
